Laravel 5 Snippets for Sublime Text
https://github.com/Lykegenes/laravel-5-snippets


Version 1.2.4
********************************************************************************

#### IMPROVEMENTS

The Blade snippets available in this package will be triggered differently
from now on. Previously, they were triggered by the `@` keyword, but it did
not work properly for all users (the @ character was ignored).
They are now available under the `Blade::` trigger keyword.

Happy coding!
