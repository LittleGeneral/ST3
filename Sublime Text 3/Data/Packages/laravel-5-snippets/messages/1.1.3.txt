Laravel 5 Snippets for Sublime Text
https://github.com/Lykegenes/laravel-5-snippets


Version 1.1.3
********************************************************************************

#### ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION

Sublime Text treats the '@' character as a "character that is considered to separate words".
This prevents the Blade snippets included in this package from triggering until you type
the whole tabTrigger parameter. To fix this, just add this line to your user preferences:

"word_separators": "./\\()\"'-:,.;<>~!#$%^&*|+=[]{}`~?"


#### NEW SNIPPETS

A few snippets were added, specifically for Blade :
	- @can and @cannot  - These are used for Authorization purposes
	- @each
	- @lang  - for I18n directly in Blade
	- @push and @stack  - Mainly used to add view-specific CSS and JS in a clean way
	- @{{  - These curvy braces will not be processed by Blade; useful for JS frameworks (Angular)
	- {{--   To add comments in Blade views
